### About myself:

I am 18 years old student from Atyrau, Kazakhstan. I came to this scool to become front-end developer. I am a student of industrial automation engineer, thats why I have some skills in programming, but they are the way easier than programming languages, but I'll point them out in my skills.

I haven't worked in such area at all, but I think I have enough personal skills to finish this course and become a developer, because it seems interesting for me. Also I interested in working in IT area because I can work remotely, so I can have extra free time and start helping my family with moneys earlier.

I hope I'll get great experience on these course with other students.

### Code example
